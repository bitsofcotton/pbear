# Description
We're in the maze the calculation in/outputs/calculates correctly or not.
So we do calculation possible thin layered on stack of the softwares but we compile and write them in thick stacked layers.

# Little Tips
On some of the known hardwares, they have /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck or similar tools. So we need to check the integrity first.

This could exclude the firmware infection after using some of the computers nor hardware/firmware supply chain attacks whether the supplier supports they're correct or not.

# Little Tips (2)
If we write the binary to some storage especially eg. micro-SD then hexdump with some another simplified *TRUSTED* hardwares, we can exclude the main machine thick stacked layers infection by reading them by our eyes.

If the binary is correctly compiled and wrote, we can boot them from amd64 machine on our binary, however, we *MUST* trust running hardware/firmwares.

So we *MUST TRUST* the hardware we have on first hypothesis even in this case.

Hint: some of the modern CPUs have rumors around some infection-like behaviour even before shipment.
