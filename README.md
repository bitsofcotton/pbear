# Description
We're in the maze the calculation in/outputs/calculates correctly or not.
So we do calculation possible thin layered on stack of the softwares but we compile them in thick stacked layers.

In fact, we should run away this with cpp98lieonn with many of the architectures we have when we're doubting the computation stacks, however, we're betting the infection root is from firmware/hardware concerns.
