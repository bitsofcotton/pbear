# Description
We're in the maze the calculation in/outputs/calculates correctly or not.
So we do calculation possible thin layered on stack of the softwares but we compile them in thick stacked layers.

In fact, we should run away this with cpp98lieonn with many of the architectures we have when we're doubting the computation stacks, however, we're betting the infection root is from firmware/hardware concerns.

However, this is only to ease our mind, not the things that infection go away even infected base systems.

# Little Tips
On some of the known hardwares, they have /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck or similar tools. So we need to check the integrity first.
