run p chain on efi.

# Description
We're in the maze the calculation in/outputs/calculates correctly or not.
So we do calculation possible thin layered on stack of the softwares but we compile and write them in thick stacked layers.

# Little Tips
On some of the known hardwares, they have /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck or similar tools. So we need to check the integrity first.

This could exclude the firmware infection after using some of the computers nor hardware/firmware supply chain attacks whether the supplier supports they're correct or not.

# Little Tips (2)
If we write the binary to some storage especially eg. micro-SD then hexdump with some another simplified *TRUSTED* hardwares, we can exclude the main machine thick stacked layers infection by reading them by our eyes.

If the binary is correctly compiled and wrote, we can boot them from amd64 machine on our binary, however, we *MUST* trust running hardware/firmwares.

So we *MUST TRUST* the hardware we have on first hypothesis even in this case.

Hint: some of the modern CPUs have rumors around some infection-like behaviour even before shipment.

# Little Tips (3)
Talk with gemini concludes we should test lieonn.hh with RP2040 or so the condition with firmware full open sourced implementation with some microSD test on SPI mode with logic gates also check byte to byte the host machine says and microSD hex logic dump says if we're doubting first base system and compilation.

This excludes whole compilation and running and showing the result paranoia into SD card reliability and RP2040 also connected LED output.

However, we got the result tend to behave the host machine and efi boot as same on amd64 this repository implementation, so we should stop doubting them in surface except for our code bug. So bug fix is the next target. However, if there's no bug on our code, so they means the results aren't false positive, so correctly we had a result, another many much of the problem is shown.
